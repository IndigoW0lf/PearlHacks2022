<H1> What we hope to achieve:</H1>
<p>Almost every advice column to women looking to thrive in technology says they need a mentor, but where are they supposed to find one? LinkedIn can be overwhelming and it isn't always easy to reach out and connect with someone you've never talked to.
Our group envisions a mentor match, where those looking to mentor can be paired with those hoping to find a mentor. Introvert friendly, no cold callling or sliding into DMs, everyone here wants to help and be helped.</p>
<p>Our website is breakingthrough.tech and along with matching mentors to mentees, it's also an aggregator for different resources on a variety of topics important to women and nonbinary techies, aiming to help those struggling with various issues to find support and reassurance. If someone is struggling with impostor syndrome, carving out their own space in the field, or trying to advocate for themselves in a salary negotiation - this website is there to help them do it.</p>
