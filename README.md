<H1> What we hope to achieve:</H1>
<p>Almost every advice column to women looking to thrive in technology says they need a mentor, but where are they supposed to get one?
Our group wants to do a mentor match, where those looking to mentor can be paired with those hoping to find a mentor. Introvert friendly, no cold callling or sliding into DMs, everyone here wants to help and be helped.</p>
<p>The website is breakingthrough.tech and along with matching mentors to mentees, it's also an aggregator for different information, to help those struggling with various issues find support and resources. If someone is struggling with impostor syndrome, carving out their own space in the field, or trying to advocate for themselves in a salary negotiation- this website is there to help them do it.</p>
